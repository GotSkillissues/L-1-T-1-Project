# L-1 T-1-Project
A game (brick breaking or DX-Ball, whichever you might want to call it) developed using iGraphics for a project.<br><br>
Hello!!!<br>
My name is Md. Mahbubul Islam Khan. I am currently studying in the CSE department at BUET. For our first-year term project, we have to develop a game or app using iGraphics, which is basically a wrapper on OpenGL. This is my first ever project. Even though the game mechanics is pretty basic it took a while for me to develop the game. But the thing is I enjoyed doing the very first project of my life. I hope this road will keep going and eventually I will build something exceptional one day.<br> Anyway, Do give the game a try even though it's not accurate. Leave out a comment too if you get the time. Till then SAYONARAAA.

<h1>Happy Gaming!!!</h1>
